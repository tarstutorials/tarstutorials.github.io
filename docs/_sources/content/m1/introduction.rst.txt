Introduction to the Course
===========================

The purpose of this site and the accompanying material found on our YouTube channel is to provide a crash course in Unity development, beginning with the basic techniques used in mobile applications and continuing into more advanced techniques used in virtual reality development. Once you are comfortable with using Unity in both spaces, the aim of the tutorials shifts to integrating real world physiological sensors with these applications. 

First, the course will teach you about each sensor, providing you with the base knowledge needed to understand and use them. From there, you will use your application development techniques to learn how to combine these two fields, first in a desktop application, and then in virtual reality. Lastly, a core goal of this tutorial series is to teach proper data collection and analysis using these physiological sensors, so that you can produce meaningful results from your studies. 

We hope that you find this tool useful, and put the time and effort into developing your skills in the two rapidly growing areas of application development and physiological sensor data collection. Ultimately, the intersection of these fields is only going to become more pervasive in the future, so having the ability to integrate them successfully is a valuable skill to have.

.. note::
    The tutorials presented here assume some prerequisite knowledge on programming. While the modules will go in-dpeth into Unity specific functions, general C# will not be taught. It is highly recommended to obtain knowledge of C# or a similar object-oriented programming language before partaking in this tutorial set.
