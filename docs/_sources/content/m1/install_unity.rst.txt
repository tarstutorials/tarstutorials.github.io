**Installing Unity Hub**

Unity Hub is a container application used to store and access our Unity Projects.
You can download and install it `here <https://unity.com/download>`_.

From here, do the following:

1. Create a Unity account.

2. Install the latest LTS Unity Editor

    * A list of all the currently supported releases can be found `here <https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/lts-releases?major_version=&minor_version=&version=&page=1>`_.
.. warning::
    Make sure to install the "Android Build Support" module and Visual Studio (if you do not already have it) alongside the editor install. You will need these later.


3. The installation is now complete. You will see how to create a new project in :ref:`install_to_new`.
